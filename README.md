# Haptic project at the UFR MIM for the master's degree

This project was realized from September to December 2023 in a group of three students. 
The book is about the story of an alien called "IP" and his odyssey on Earth. 
We used the mouse [Logitech Wingman Force Feedback](https://www.microsoft.com/buxtoncollection/detail.aspx?id=130) as haptic device.
The project could be executed without any haptic device and a Headset is recommended for a better audio experience.

## Requirements
- VirtualBox with Windows 7 (32 bit)
- immersion corporation **ifc library**
- Qt creator
- Qt 5.15 LTS
